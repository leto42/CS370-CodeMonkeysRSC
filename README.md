# CS370-CodeMonkeysRSC

Random Song Chooser ("Song Genie") for CS 370 Project

Currently implemented:
User will choose a genre and then a random song that belongs to that category will appear with a YouTube video.

Original plan (unimplemented):

User has the option to favorite the song.
   
If the song is favorited, the user will be asked if they would like to view an album by the same artist.

User can save albums and view them in a different activity.
  
User can look at play songs/albums that they favorited/saved previously.
